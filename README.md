# pyrsc
Sort My Library is a small Python script I use to order/sort my MP3s from a input flat repository to a structured output directory.

There is not much about it. It's very small and does not do much, but it helps me saving time by automating boring sorting operations. 

Maybe could it help bome Python beginning, as a base for a start, trying to achieve something similar.

## Prerequisites

This project requires to have Python 3 installed on your computer. 

## Getting Started

### Linux

If not already available, you will be likely to install Python like this:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

Then simply call pysml/pysml.py from the command line and start playing with options:
```
python3 pysml.py --help
```

### Windows

You will have to download and install the latest Python 3 package from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Then, locate where python.exe was installed, e.g. under: C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32, open a command prompt, get there and call pyrsc/pyrsc.py via python.exe:
```
C:\Users\JohnDoe>
C:\Users\JohnDoe>cd AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32
C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32>python.exe C:\Users\JohnDoe\pysml\pysml.py --help
```
