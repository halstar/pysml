## To do list

* Add some robustness around, to avoid Python exceptions but present clear error messages instead, e.g. when there's bad permissions on input/output directories.
* Add an option to move files to the output directory, instead of copying them.
* Make possible to use the input directory as the output directory.
* etc.
